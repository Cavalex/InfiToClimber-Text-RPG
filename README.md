# InfiToClimber-Text-RPG
A text RPG I made with sloppy code and a bunch of bugs, need help and tips.

Run "game and events.py" to run it.

Future Plans ( by order of relevance/importance ):

- A Boss mechanic for each 15 levels passed
- More potions
- Monster drops ( items, not money )
- Monsters that carry weapons/armor and are stronger ( linked with the above topic )
- More items
- Add music
- Add graphics
