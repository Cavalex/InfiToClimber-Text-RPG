# InfiToClimber-Text-RPG
A text RPG I made with sloppy code and a bunch of bugs, help and tips are appreciated.
Made in Python 3.7.0

To play the game just execute "Game.py" in any Python IDE.

Future Plans ( by order of relevance/importance ):
- A Boss mechanic for each 15 levels passed
- More potions
- Monster drops ( items, not money )
- Monsters that carry weapons/armor and are stronger ( linked with the above topic )
- More items
- Add music
- Add graphics
